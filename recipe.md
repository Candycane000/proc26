1-Preheat the oven to 450 F and line a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.

2-In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

3-Put frozen butter in a blender and pulse a few times, or chop into little cubes. Toss into the flour mixture.

4-Break the butter up and thoroughly mix into the flour (with your hands is easiest).

5-In a small mixing bowl, mix together milk, vanilla, and almond extract. Using a fork, slowly pour the liquid into the dry mixture and stir until it comes together and there are no longer floury bits. (Don’t overwork it — you’ll want to work quickly and make sure the dough stays cold.) Using your hands, press it together into a ball.

6-Dust a clean surface with flour and put the dough on the surface. Knead gently until your dough comes together and looks smooth, but is still sticky. Dust flour over the top. If it’s too dry or doesn’t hold together, add a tablespoon of milk at a time until it holds together.

7-With a rolling pin, flatten the dough until it’s about 1 inch thick. Use a 2 and 1/2-inch circle cutter coated in flour (or the closest you have) to cut out scones. You should be able to just press and lift. After you can’t cut any more out, roll the scraps into a ball and repeat.

8-Place the scones on the cookie sheet. You should have 6-8 of them by the time you’re done. Put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes while you make the egg wash.

9-In a small bowl, whisk together an egg and 2 tablespoons of milk.

10-Take your scones out of the freezer and coat with the egg wash. Then, top with almonds and coarse sugar if desired.

11-Put your scones in the oven and turn the oven temperature down to 400 F. Bake until golden, about 12-15 minutes. They should rise quite a bit and puff out just a little bit. Don’t worry if they crack on the sides a little; as long as they went in cold, they’ll retain their shape.

12-Take them out of the oven and let cool for a couple of minutes. Serve with butter, cream, or honey. (I also like to mix butter, honey, and cinnamon for a nice spread!)
